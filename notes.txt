//NOTES

/**
 * 1) import { Provider } from "react-redux";
 * -wrap the App component in the render with the Provider
 *
 * 2) Go to App component.
 *
 * Add method mapStateToProps
 * mapStateToProps means which properties of my global application state, do I want to use in this component, and to
 * which local properties in this component do I want to map them
 *
 * //this gets the state passed from Redux
 * //return a key value pair where key is a property name that you can use in your component
 *
 * //the names will be whatever you assigned to them in your combinedReducers I believe
 * //in the case below we are using all the properties from the global state. this will allow you to simply now pass
 * their properties in as a prop to a component. i.e) <CampusList campuses = {this.props.campuses} />
 *
 * const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
 *  return {
 *      students: state.students,
 *      campuses: state.campuses
 * }
 * }
 *
 * const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) =>{
 *
 *  return {
 *  addStudent: (student) =>{
 *      dispatch(addStudent(student))  //you can import this as an action creator I believe. Do I need to pass in student as well?
 *      }
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * OR IS IT THE PROPER WAY TO DO IT AS
 *
 * return {
 *  addStudent:(student) => {
 *  dispatch({
 *      type:"ADD_STUDENT",
 *       payload: student
 *          })
 *      }
 *  }
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * //connect needs to be imported from 'react-redux'
 *
 * 3) call connect function to connect reactjs with redux for your component to have access to the store with the mapStateToProps
 *
 * export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(App);
 *
 * Why are we calling the connect function? We are calling the connect function because we want to tell react-redux
 * that I want to connect this component here to my redux store.
 * I am already providing the store to the whole application, but it doesn't mean it will connect to all of your components.
 *
 * This is useful because you can choose which properties and actions you want to choose. This is done with the mapStateToProps
 * and mapDispatchToProps
 *
 *
 * mapStateToProps tells reactJs which properties of the global state do I want to use in this component, and to which
 * local properties accessible to the props keyword (i.e) this.props.students , do I want to map the keyword to.
 *
 * mapDispatchToProps does the same but not for the properties but for the actions I can execute and send to reducers.
 *
 * We can map key value pairs here which will also be accessible with this.props, but we are mapping functions that dispatch
 * an action that we will use in this app.
 *
 *
 * NOTE: You don't have to connect Redux store with every component, if for simple things, you can still pass it down
 * as a sub component.
 *


 Only use redux if you need to. If you are creating a student there is most likely not a reason to use the redux store because we are 
 not going to be grabbing the new data. The point of the form is to post a new student or campus. The thunk that fetches the students 
 and campuses is handled elsewhere so the form component need not worry bout that. 



 //Why do I have to dispatch the thunk that is related to this student in order for it to hard refresh my page (UpateStudent.js)

 TODO: Get a better understanding of how redux store makes state re-render
 

 maybe make description not required later for updateCampus.js
